                    <p>My name is Jacob Cravey and I was born and raised in Tucson Arizona. I graduated from Marana High
                        School in 2010, and joined the army shortly thereafter. I served for four years as an
                        Armament/Electrical/Avionic Systems Repairer for the AH-64 Apache Attack Helicopter, where I
                        started getting a background in both analog and digital microelectronics.</p>
                    <p>After finishing my time in the Army, I bounced around from various jobs including construction,
                        retail and even community association management. I finally decided it was time to do better,
                        and I started an Associates in Information Technology with University of Phoenix. Part way
                        through my degree, I found an opening at Apex Microtechnology, as an equipment maintenance tech.
                        Having some background in electronics, I was able to get the job.</p>
                    <p>While working for Apex, I quickly proved myself and was placed into a process engineering role.
                        While doing this I was exposed to some basic programming, ladder logic and even Visual Basic,
                        and fell in love with programming. After finishing my Associates I decided to persue an
                        education in programming and coding. I quickly found the U of A bootcamp, and now, here we are!
